Install .NET SDK:

If you don't have the .NET SDK installed, download and install it from the official website: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet.
Create a C# File: Create or obtain a C# source code file using a text editor like Notepad, Visual Studio Code, or any other code editor.

Open Command Prompt or Terminal:

On Windows, press Win+R, type "cmd," and press Enter.
On macOS or Linux, open the Terminal.
Navigate to the Directory with Your C# File:

Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where your C# file is located.
Compile the C# File:

Use the csc command followed by your C# source file's name:

Copy code
csc YourFile.cs
This will generate an executable file (e.g., YourFile.exe) in the same directory.

Run the Compiled Program:

Type the name of the generated executable and press Enter:

Copy code
YourFile.exe
Your C# program will run, and the output will be displayed in the command prompt.

These are the basic steps to open and compile a C# source code file. The exact steps may vary depending on your development environment and the specific requirements of your project.
